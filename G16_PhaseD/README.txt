Hi Tutor(s),

This is Group 16's "pure phase A, B , and C integration", with no added functionality.

This program is designed to run on a Mac, and we cannot guarantee it will run on Windows etc. OS compatibility was not stipulated in the assignment specs and thus could not be expected of us. If you can't run this program on your OS, then give it to a tutor who has a Mac please. Cheers!

Before attempting to run, please ensure you have downloaded the dependencies located in G16_PhaseD/programs/requirements.txt

To run the program, in Terminal, simply navigate to [...]/G16_PhaseD/programs and run the following command:

	python processD.py

It may take a few seconds to run, but Webots should start and the simulation should run automatically.
